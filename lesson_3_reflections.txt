When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository can be useful for a large number of reasonse. These include saftey precautions like remote storage and backup 
so that if anything happens to the local file you still have all of your work available. In addition, a remote repository can be 
useful if you work on multiple workstations. It provides you with the ability to update your work across different devices
and from different locations. And finally, a remote repository can be useful for group colaboration, as it allows teamembers to
update a single version of the project in the repositry with their indiviudual changes, all from their separate locations. 


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

The main idea is that you have control over what information is stored in each location. This gives you the ability to change it 
when it makes sense to do so. If you have automatic updates, updates that are incomplete or from other people working on the 
project could be uploaded at any time, potentially harming what you might be working on. Manual updates provide you with the 
control to make these happen when it makes sense to what you are trying to accomplish. 


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A branch is where you have taken a file and saved changes that differ from the direction of the master file. It is where you would
build a different version of a similar thing. A clone is where you make a copy of a repository to another location. This can occur
locally on a machine, locally across machines, or via the web. A fork is a specific type of clone. It is a clone that occurs when 
you copy another repository into your git hub account.
