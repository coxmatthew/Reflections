What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a respository is the process of taking an existing directory and making it into a git style version control repository. When you initialize a repository, it allows that directory to store information about previous versions of files stored in that directory, or in other words, it contains the information about previous commits that have been made for particular files or groups of flies. You need to initialize a repository to use git and version control. Initializing a repository gives you the functional virtual space to practice version control with your files.
