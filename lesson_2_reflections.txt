What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a respository is the process of taking an existing directory and making it into a git style version control repository. When you initialize a repository, it allows that directory to store information about previous versions of files stored in that directory, or in other words, it contains the information about previous commits that have been made for particular files or groups of flies. You need to initialize a repository to use git and version control. Initializing a repository gives you the functional virtual space to practice version control with your files.  


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

All three areas can be thought of as distinct locations where specific things happen and are stored. The working directory is where your current changes to a file are stored. It is where a file is saved to when you click save. Files can be moved from the working directory to a repositry if you want to save a snap shot of what that directory and its files looked like at a particular point in time. A repository is essentially a directory that is connected to the working directory and which stores older versions of the files contained in the working directory so that you can look back through time at what existed in that working directory at different times. The staging area is the space between the working directory and the repositry. It is where files are temporarily placed before the before being added to the repository. It allows for you to make back up copies of older versions of files in the working directory without having back up files that weren't recently changed in the directory. This allows for better usegage of storage space.
